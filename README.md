# PasswordStrengthChecker
This is a simple Python script to check the strength of a given password. The script analyzes the password based on criteria such as length, uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The script also provides feedback to the user on how to make their password more secure if it is found to be weak.

**Requirements**
This script requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

argparse
re
You can install these libraries using pip:

Copy code
pip install argparse
pip install re


**Usage**
To use the password checker, simply run the main.py script with the password you want to check as the argument:

css
Copy code
python main.py [password]
For example:

css
Copy code
python main.py MyPassword123!

**Output**
If the password is found to be strong, the script will output the message "Your password is strong. Keep it up!". If the password is found to be weak, the script will output feedback on how to make the password more secure.

**Example**
